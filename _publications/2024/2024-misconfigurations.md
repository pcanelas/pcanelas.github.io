  The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a popular framework for building robot software from reusable components, but configuring and connecting these components correctly is challenging. 
  Developers often face issues due to unstated assumptions, leading to misconfigurations that can result in unpredictable and dangerous behavior. 
  To improve the reliability of ROS projects, it is critical to identify the broader set of  misconfigurations. 
  To that end, we perform a study on ROS Answers to categorize these misconfigurations and evaluate how well existing detection techniques cover them. We identified 12 high-level categories and 50 sub-categories, with 27 not covered by current techniques.
