I am a Ph.D. Student at [LASIGE](https://www.lasige.pt/) at the [Faculdade de CiÃªncias da Universidade de Lisboa](https://ciencias.ulisboa.pt/) and at the [Institute for Software Research](https://www.isri.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am working under the supervision of [Alcides Fonseca](https://wiki.alcidesfonseca.com/) and [Sara Silva](https://ciencias.ulisboa.pt/pt/perfil/sgsilva) at FCUL, and [Chris Timperley](http://www.christimperley.co.uk/) at CMU. I have a special interest in programming languages, program synthesis, program repair, and evolutionary algorithms (namely in the combination of all of them!).
