# About me

I am a PhD Student in LASIGE at the Faculty of Sciences, University of Lisbon under the supervision of Alcides Fonseca. I finished my BSc. and MSc. degree in Computer Science in the same university. I have a special interest in programming languages, program synthesis, and evolutionary algorithms. Outside of 'geek world', I'm an easy-going person who likes traveling and exploring the local gastronomy.

Other than university I have also been enrolled in other academic projects and schools. You can find the most recent ones below.
EDP University Challenge - Portugal, Top15 (2020)

Participated in the EDP University Challenge, an international initiative for young students, along with Guilherme Espada and under the supervision of Alcides Fonseca. We were able to achieve the top15 out of 1152 teams (4138 students) with the project: ecoServer - a system to optimize the energy impact of servers in data centers at the EDP University Challenge.
COST ACTION CA15140 - ImAppNIO (2019)

Attended the Improving Applicability of Nature-Inspired Optimisation by Joining Theory and Practice Doctoral Training School (ImAppNIO) during my second year as a Master student. The objective of the school, other than visiting Coimbra, was to study the different evolutionary approaches and the respective theoretical and pratical evaluation.
