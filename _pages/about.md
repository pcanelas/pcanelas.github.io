<p text-align=justify>
I am a PhD Student in <a href="https://www.lasige.di.fc.ul.pt/">LASIGE</a> at the <a href="https://ciencias.ulisboa.pt/">Faculty of Sciences</a>, University of Lisbon under the supervision of <a href="https://wiki.alcidesfonseca.com/">Alcides Fonseca</a>. I finished my BSc. and MSc. degree in Computer Science in the same university. I have a special interest in programming languages, program synthesis, and evolutionary algorithms. 

Outside of 'geek world', I'm an easy-going person who likes traveling and exploring the local gastronomy.

Other than university I have also been enrolled in other academic projects and schools. You can find the most recent ones below.
