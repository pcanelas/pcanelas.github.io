I am working under the supervision of [Alcides Fonseca](https://wiki.alcidesfonseca.com/) and  at University of Lisbon, and [Chris Timperley](http://www.christimperley.co.uk/) at Carnegie Mellon. I have a special interest in program analysis, program repair, evolutionary computation and robotic systems.

Currently, I am working on the verification, detection and repair of component misconfigurations in robotic systems.
