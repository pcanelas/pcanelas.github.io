  <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
  I am a PhD student working under the supervision of 
  <a href="https://wiki.alcidesfonseca.com">Alcides Fonseca</a>,
  <a href="https://eden.dei.uc.pt/~sara/research.html">Sara Silva</a>, and
  <a href="https://chris.timperley.info">Christopher S. Timperley</a>.
  My research focuses on developing program analysis techniques to detect errors in software systems. 
  Previously, I worked on evolutionary program synthesis using refinement types, and I am currently closely researching the application of software engineering techniques to the robotics field (Software Engineering for Robotics).</p>
